[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/guideencodemoe-mkdocs/badge/?version=latest)](https://guideencodemoe-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)

This is a mkdocs version of the gitbook guide at <https://guide.encode.moe/>.

It currently has a smaller footprint of around 19MB compared to 84MB due to lack of commit history, no build instructions/plug-ins, and PNGCRUSH compressed images.

A translated version of this guide is possible if someone wants to clone this repo and translate it file-by-file. I can add that as a new translation project on <https://readthedocs.org/>.

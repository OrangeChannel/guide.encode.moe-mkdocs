# Media Containers

The Mastroka Media Container is an open source, open standard multimedia container that is heavily used in the fansubbing scene. Mastroka video, or `.mkv` files are the standard for soft-subbed releases as they allow for multiple subtitles tracks and chapters which are a somewhat unique feature to the container. The MPEG-4 Part 14 or MP4 is another container format but it is limited in its usefulness for fansubbing.
